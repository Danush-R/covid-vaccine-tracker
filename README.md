Introducing my 3rd project on COVID✨19 Global Tracker Dashboard, a robust tool powered by Tableau. 
Its purpose? To keep a vigilant eye on worldwide vaccination progress and the pandemic's broader impact. Let's delve into its standout features:

1️⃣  Global Reach: Seamlessly access vaccination data spanning across countries, states, and continents.
2️⃣  Versatile Visualizations : Harnessing the power of Map, Bar, and Scatter plots for a holistic grasp of the data.
3️⃣  Major Players Spotlight : Zero in on pivotal vaccination progress snapshots in USA, India, Russia, China, and the UK.
4️⃣  Dynamic Insights : Dive deeper, zooming in on regions or specific countries for laser✨focused, pertinent data.

 Metrics in Focus: 
✨Partially vaccinated against COVID-19 (of world total population): 3.83 billion
✨ Fully vaccinated against COVID-19 (of world total population): 2.94 billion
✨ Average share of unvaccinated individuals (of world total population): 51.26%
✨ Comparative barcharts, dissecting the percentage of fully vaccinated versus partially vaccinated, country by country.
✨ A scale visualizing the population with at least one COVID-19 dose.
✨ A Geo Map pinpointing countries with the highest number of vaccinated individuals per hundred.
✨ Real-time updates for streamlined vaccine distribution management, including daily administered doses.
✨ Concurrent real-time data tracking COVID-19 booster doses relative to population percentages, delineated by country.
✨ An insightful graph illustrating the interplay between GDP and vaccination performance, unraveling economic implications.
✨ A bar scale vividly presenting the density of new COVID-19 cases per million.
✨ Tree maps plotting a country's new cases per million against the overall population.
✨ A dynamic bubble chart offering a visual on death cases per million in relation to total cases and population.
